When you press your finger on your wrist right now â€” you feel *skin*. But something odd happens if you pause for just 2 seconds more.

You start to feelâ€¦ softness. Space. A little wobble.

This is the first crack in your illusion.

Atoms are mostly empty space. That means: you are not a 'solid body', youâ€™re mostly dancing emptiness pretending to be solid for a while.

ðŸŒ€ Practice:
Place your finger gently on your wrist.
Now breathe in for 6 seconds â€” hold â€” breathe out for 6.
Do this 3 times.

What you're feeling isnâ€™t just skin â€” itâ€™s a quiet cosmic movie happening inside you.
