      content: "That face staring back at you? It isn't you. At 5, it was a stranger with chubby cheeks. At 15, a stranger with teenage angst. Soon, it will be a stranger with wrinkles. The face is a temporary mask, always changing, always aging. But the one looking through its eyes... hasn't aged a single day. That one is timeless.",

      content: "Your mind is a group chat you can't leave. 'You're not good enough.' 'Remember that stupid thing you said?' 'I'm hungry.' Thoughts pop up like notifications, uninvited and random. You didn't 'think' them. They just appeared. This proves you are not the one generating the thoughts.",

      content: "In a game, when your avatar gets sniped, YOU don't feel the bullet. You just quit the match and grab a snack. Your body is your avatar in the game of life.

      content: "Your attention is a spotlight. Whatever it shines on becomes 'real.' The rest of the universe‚Äîthe sounds, the room, your own body‚Äîfades to black.
