As you inhale, draw in the cool, silver light of distant galaxies, feeling it enter your lungs, your blood, your very cells.

As you exhale, release a soft stream of shadow and illusion, watching it dissolve into the infinite night. Continue this rhythm for seven minutes, letting the light grow brighter with every breath, until you feel yourself dissolving into the cosmic field of pure being.",

Hold a mirror so that your eyes meet your own gaze — not the gaze of the self you present to the world, but the gaze that peers from beneath centuries of masks. Let your breathing slow as you watch yourself with unwavering softness, noticing the small shifts, the flickers of recognition, the ancient familiarity. Stay with this meeting until the face in the glass feels less like ‘you’ and more like the infinite witness that has always been here.",

Feel the stillness at your center deepen with each passing moment, as if your awareness is the axis around which all things turn. Stay in this presence until the difference between ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ begins to fade, and you are only the space in which the dance unfolds.",

On the exhale, release a single, sustained tone — a hum, a vowel, or a sound that feels natural — letting it emerge from the center of your chest. With each vibration, imagine the sound dissolving into a vast emptiness that is not outside you, but everywhere. After several rounds, stop making sound and listen; in the silence, you may begin to hear the hum of existence itself.",
